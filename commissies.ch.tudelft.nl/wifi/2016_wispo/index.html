				Welcome to the web page of the WiFi! On this page, you will find alot of information about
				the upcoming skiing trip of W.I.S.V. 'Christiaan Huygens'. 
			</h1>
				<h> Where and when will we go? </h>
						<p> On the evening of Friday, January 29, we will leave
 						the beautiful city of Delft to head for the even more beautiful
						 French mountains. We'll gather with 50 enthusiastic skiers and 
						snowboarders at 'Christiaan Huygens'. Overnight, we will travel 
						by bus to France. When you wake up, you'll be at ski resort 
						Le Grande Domaine in the lovely village of St. François Longchamps.
						The pistes here reach over 2500 meters above sea level and with 
						more than 150 km of ski slope there is plenty 
						of room for both beginners and the more experienced sporters. 
						After a long day of intense activity or relaxing 
						in the warm winter sun there will be time to have a drink in the 
						famous Yeti Bar or one of the other small bars in the village. 
						The party will continue till early in the morning. Luckily the 
						fresh morning breeze in the mountains will help you wake up. 
						This will continue throughout the week.
						&nbsp
						<p>
						Unfortunately, everything
						 has an end (nur eine Bratwurst hat zwei!). On Friday, February 5, 
						we will head back to Delft.	</p>
