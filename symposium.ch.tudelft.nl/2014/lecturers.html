									Roughly 90% of the worldwide data has been created over the past 2 years. Companies in all branches are under increasing pressure to retrieve insights from their available data. According to IBM the data explosion at companies takes place in three areas: velocity, volume and variety of data.
									<br><br>
									For example:
									A hospital is estimated to have 665 terabytes of data in images and patient files on average. How will hospitals cope with a growth from 167 terabytes currently, to 665 terabytes in 2015?
									Five million transactions take place world wide every second, but which transactions are fraudulous?
									Energy meters produce data 350 billion times every year, but how do you predict the energy usage of a household?
									Twitter has 12 terabytes of tweets posted every day, but who analyses these to determine the sentiment about their product?
									Every day 500 million phone records are logged, but which customer switches to another telephone provider?
									It is crucial to embrace technology and to use this data to enhance operational management, but how do we do this and what are possible misconceptions?
									And finally, what do these new technologies mean for the data specialists?
									<br><br>
									Frans Bentlage will provide you with answers to all these questions in his presentation.

								<i>Visualizing (Big) Data using t-SNE</i><br><br>

									Visualization techniques are essential tools for every data scientist. Unfortunately, the majority of visualization techniques can only be used to inspect a limited number of variables of interest simultaneously. As a result, these techniques are not suitable for big data that is very high-dimensional.
									<br><br>
									An effective way to visualize high-dimensional data is to represent each data object by a two-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are represented by nearby points, and that dissimilar objects are represented by distant points. The resulting two-dimensional points can be visualized in a scatter plot. This leads to a map of the data that reveals the underlying structure of the objects, such as the presence of clusters.
									<br><br>
									We present a new technique to embed high-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional map, called t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), that produces substantially better results than alternative techniques. We demonstrate the value of t-SNE in domains such as computer vision and bioinformatics. In addition, we show how to scale up t-SNE to Big Data sets with millions of objects, and we present an approach to visualize objects of which the similarities are non-metric (such as semantic similarities).

									During the past decades, public transport operators around the globe have adopted smart card based ticketing systems. These systems generate travel data of unprecedented detail and volume. During this talk we discuss some of the experiences and challenges of our research group while working with smart card data, mostly as it is available within Dutch Railways.
									<br><br>
									There are two main questions of which we will address algorithmic aspects and practical details of the intended applications: 1) How can we deduce which trains have actually been used by the passenger, given a check in and check out; and 2) how can we detect behavioural patterns in smart card data that are useful for the creation of demand models.

He obtained both his Bachelor and Masters degree in computing science cum laude at Utrecht University. He currently works within the 'Complexity in Public Transport' project, which is part of NWO's complexity program. Within this project, he focuses on ways to utilize public transport capacity more efficiently in a way that is benificial for both the passenger and the operator. He has presented his work at a number of transport related conferences, such as TRISTAN and IEEE-ITSC.

									In a steadily growing number of scientific disciplines, numerical methods of increasing complexity are now part of the standard tool set of scientists.  In the course of these computations, massive data are generated at an ever-growing pace, as evident by the modern push for "exascale computing."  However, while computational capabilities continue to increase, the same human beings must analyze growing mountains of data to transform 'ideas' into 'insight'. This requires that the interface between computation and human ingenuity -- that is, visualization -- becomes more efficient.  In this talk a number of current research concepts are presented, each of which targets a number of key areas in the 'visualization pipeline'. The aim is to develop generic, scalable methods usable by a wide range of applications.

									Big data is seen as the next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity. The central idea is data fusion and the smart application of it to discover new insights and services that provide value. In this endeavour, mathematical sciences, computer and information sciences, and business sciences play a crucial role. We will illustrate this by studying big data on Twitter. We discuss how science helps us to forecast which topics are going to be a trending topic. More specifically, we will identify topics that are going to be news in the media and potentially detect them faster than news reporters.

									In today’s Businesses, everything needs to be connected and go faster than ever before. The end-users exposure to technology and IT apps is much higher than a decade ago and there is an ongoing ‘Gamification’ in corporate environments.
									<br>
									The End Consumer spends a lot of his time on the internet and social networks, is not shy of giving his opinion about products online and his sphere of influence can potentially influence the perception and success of a Brand.
									<br>
									On the other hand, lots of companies are facing margin reductions, customer churn and are looking at using all available resources, including their data, to turn that tide. The topic Big Data is frequently seen as the solution to all problems, but is often approached as merely a technical subject that needs to be dealt with by putting in a couple of smart brains and smart technologies together to be able to make sense of all the data companies are capturing in their environments. In a couple of years the Big Data challenges we face now, will be dealt with as just another project, the tools and techniques will evolve fast and in the end will become mainstream assets. In this session we will show that combining multiple disciplines, like Data Management, In Memory Computing, Predictive Analysis and Mobile apps will help getting Big Data projects to the next level.

This year, it has become mandatory for hospitals to publish the results of this analysis. As market leader, ChipSoft is responsible for more than half of the hospitals generating and sending this data. 
									<br><br>
									This talk will address a number of points concerning the usage of the HSMR model within hospitals based in the Netherlands. Some aspects covered will be: how can a statistical model be used to compare hospitals with differing patient types and diagnoses, how can we use this model and the collected data to detect issues and substandard services to improve the quality of care in the hospitals, what techniques can we use to reduce the administrative burden this research imposes, and what are the consequences for stakeholders when this data is used by patients and the media.
